/// Handles scrolling gestures for applications that have grabbed the mouse
/// (i.e. [Terminal.mouseMode] is not [MouseMode.none] — Claude Code, Codex,
/// Gemini, vim, …). Such an app runs in the alternate screen, which has no
/// xterm scrollback to scroll; instead it drives its own viewport from wheel
/// input, so a finger swipe is converted to mouse-wheel escape sequences and
/// sent to the app.
///
/// The gate is the app's mouse mode, NOT [Terminal.isUsingAltBuffer]: those
/// two diverge mid-session (a CLI can sit in the alternate buffer while it has
/// momentarily turned mouse reporting off, e.g. a sub-pager or a modal), and a
/// wheel report sent to an app that isn't listening for the mouse just
/// vanishes — leaving a swipe silently doing nothing. Gating on mouse mode is
/// exactly what the (working) web terminal does (`mouseTrackingMode !== 'none'`):
/// when the app isn't tracking the mouse we do nothing here and let the inner
/// viewport's native scroll handle the scrollback.
