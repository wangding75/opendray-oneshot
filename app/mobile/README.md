# opendray mobile

The Flutter control client for an opendray gateway — feature parity
with the web admin (Sessions, Channels, Integrations, Memory, Git,
Settings). It attaches to a **running gateway**; it is not a gateway
itself.

## Build & install

Full walkthrough — Android APK sideload and iOS install via Xcode,
plus making the gateway reachable from the phone:

**[→ `docs/mobile-app.md`](../../docs/mobile-app.md)**

Available in 10 languages (English, 简体中文, فارسی, Español, Português,
日本語, 한국어, Français, Deutsch, Русский) — use the language switcher at
the top of the guide.

## Quick reference

```sh
flutter pub get

# Android
flutter build apk --release        # build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
flutter install                    # build + install to an attached device

# iOS (needs a Mac + Xcode)
open ios/Runner.xcworkspace        # set a signing Team, then ▶ Run
flutter run --release -d <device>  # or drive from the CLI

# run against a dev gateway
flutter run
```
