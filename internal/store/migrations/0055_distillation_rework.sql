-- 0055 — distillation rework: clean slate for playbooks (Cortex).
--
-- Pre-gate playbooks were one-liner "memories" with no procedure, no
-- evidence, no value — promoting them produced junk skills. Playbooks
-- are DERIVED data: archive them all (reversible) and let the next
-- reflect cycle re-distill under the new structural quality gate
-- (≥3 steps, concrete commands/paths, verbatim evidence quotes from
-- the work log, a real trigger).
--
-- Skills are NOT touched — the operator retires those by hand from
-- the workbench (some may have been hand-curated).

-- (knowledge_nodes has no archived_reason column — the reason lives
-- in provenance instead.)

   SET archived_at = NOW(),
       provenance = jsonb_set(COALESCE(provenance, '{}'::jsonb),
                              '{archived_reason}',

-- Clear every project's reflect signature so the dirty-check doesn't
-- skip re-distillation of unchanged feedstock.
