// This file is the single source of truth for the session lifecycle
// state machine. It encodes the transition matrix agreed in the
// 2026-07 state-machine hardening design (docs/design/session-state-machine.md):
// every (State, Event) pair either maps to a well-defined next State or
// is rejected as an illegal transition.
//
// It is intentionally PURE and side-effect free — no DB, no PTY, no
// locks — so it can be exhaustively table-tested and adopted incrementally
// by the Manager/store as the authoritative guard. Persisted states are
// unchanged (session.go still owns the State enum and the sessions.state
// column); the three interrupted sub-states are modelled here as a
// refinement layer (InterruptReason), not as new persisted enum values.

// Event enumerates the lifecycle signals that drive a session between
// States. A transition is legal iff Next(state, event) returns a nil
// error. See docs/design/session-state-machine.md for the full matrix.
